//! `path-clean` is a Rust port of the the `cleanname` procedure from the Plan 9 C library, and is similar to
//! [`path.Clean`](https://golang.org/pkg/path/#Clean) from the Go standard library. It works as follows:
//!
//! 1. Reduce multiple slashes to a single slash.
//! 2. Eliminate `.` path name elements (the current directory).
//! 3. Eliminate `..` path name elements (the parent directory) and the non-`.` non-`..`, element that precedes them.
//! 4. Eliminate `..` elements that begin a rooted path, that is, replace `/..` by `/` at the beginning of a path.
//! 5. Leave intact `..` elements that begin a non-rooted path.
//!
//! If the result of this process is an empty string, return the string `"."`, representing the current directory.
//!
//! It performs this transform lexically, without touching the filesystem. Therefore it doesn't do
//! any symlink resolution or absolute path resolution. For more information you can see ["Getting Dot-Dot
//! Right"](https://9p.io/sys/doc/lexnames.html).
//!
//! For convenience, the [`PathClean`] trait is exposed and comes implemented for [`std::path::PathBuf`].
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::path::PathBuf;
//! use path_clean::{clean, PathClean};
//! assert_eq!(clean("hello/world/.."), PathBuf::from("hello"));
//! assert_eq!(
//!     PathBuf::from("/test/../path/").clean(),
//!     PathBuf::from("/path")
//! );
//! ```
